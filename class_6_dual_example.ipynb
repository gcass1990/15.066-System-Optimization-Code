    "So, here the objective does not increase by 3 (old dual variable of first constraint) times 5 (increase of that constraint) which would equal 15 (i.e., we'd get 62+15), but rather by just 6. The reason is that beyond a certain point (in fact, beyond 16) increasing the RHS of the first constraint no longer yields incremental value. For example, if we changed the first constraint's RHS to 16.001, we already get a dual value of 0 for that constraint (see below). So one needs to be very careful when considering the dual value of 3 at 16: reducing the RHS to 15 would indeed reduce the objective by 3, but increasing the RHS to 17 would not increase the objective by 3.
